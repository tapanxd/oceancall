# OceanCall ‚Äì Whale Sound Classifier

**OceanCall** is an AI-powered marine sound classification system designed to identify whale species from underwater `.wav` audio recordings. The project combines deep audio feature extraction with traditional machine learning classification and is deployed as a scalable, cloud-native application using AWS services.

## üß† Core Features

- **Whale Species Detection**: Classifies marine audio into five species ‚Äî Common Dolphin, Humpback Whale, Killer Whale, Pilot Whale, and Sperm Whale.
- **PANNs Embedding Extraction**: Leverages pretrained CNN14 models (from PANNs) to extract robust audio embeddings.
- **XGBoost Classification**: Lightweight, high-performance model for final species prediction.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Supports low-latency predictions via AWS Lambda and SageMaker.

## üì¶ Architecture Overview

1. **User Uploads** `.wav` audio via web interface.
2. **Lambda Function** validates the file and stores it in **S3**.
3. A **SageMaker Endpoint** is invoked:
   - Loads audio
   - Extracts embeddings via PANNs
   - Predicts species via XGBoost
4. Result is returned to the frontend and visualized with confidence scores and summaries.
